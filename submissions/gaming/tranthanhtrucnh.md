## Project
### Name & Category
Project: FarQuest: zkGaming Adventure  
Category: gaming  

### Description
FarQuest is a decentralized adventure game built on the Soundness Layer where players complete quests, collect zk-verified artifacts, and compete in a provably fair world.  
It solves the problem of **fairness and transparency in blockchain gaming** by ensuring every outcome is verifiable and gas costs are minimized.  

### SL Integration
- Use Soundness Layer’s zk verification to prove quest completion and battle outcomes.  
- Store lightweight zk proofs on-chain, heavy logic off-chain for scalability.  
- Integrate SL SDK for trustless validation of game events.  

## Technical
### Architecture
1. **Client (Web3 frontend)**: Player interface, quest interactions, wallet login.  
2. **Game Logic Engine (off-chain)**: Handles combat, quest logic, proof generation.  
3. **Soundness Layer integration**: Verifies zk proofs and records quest results.  
4. **Smart Contracts**: Quest registry, NFT artifact minting, leaderboard tracking.  

### Stack
- Frontend: React + Next.js  
- Backend: Node.js + zkSNARKs toolkit  
- Blockchain: Soundness Layer (SL) + EVM-compatible networks for interoperability  
- Storage: IPFS for assets, WALRUS for proofs  

### Features
- zk-verified quest completion  
- Artifact NFTs minted upon proof verification  
- On-chain leaderboard with provable fairness  

## Timeline
**PoC (2–4 weeks)**  
- Smart contract skeleton + SL integration tests  
- Basic quest engine with zk proof prototype  
- Simple UI for login and questing  

**MVP (4–8 weeks)**  
- Full quest engine with multiple quest types  
- Production-ready UI/UX  
- Community testing and user feedback  

## Innovation
FarQuest introduces **zk-proof-based fairness for gaming**, ensuring all outcomes are trustless and tamper-proof. It blends **NFT artifacts, provable gameplay, and decentralized leaderboards**, creating a unique zk-gaming experience.
